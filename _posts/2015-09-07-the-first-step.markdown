Like the beginning of many things, this little personal website/blog has to start with a single page.

So then...I guess I should start at the beginning. But the beginning of what exactly?

I think a lot of people like to partition their lives into little chapters or episodes. In a way it makes life easier to reflect on, and perhaps doing so creates a distance from which the trodden road behind ones' self is made more tangible.

For me, it's been one contiguous experience, the beginning of which having long been a foggy haze. But it was certainly blessed.

Perhaps it's not about 'the beginning' but setting the right stage to tell a story. This is the beginning of that story.
